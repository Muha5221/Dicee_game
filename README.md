## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript

## How It Works

1. When the page loads or is refreshed:
   - JavaScript generates two random numbers between 1-6
   - The corresponding dice images are displayed for each player
   - The higher number wins (though the winner isn't currently displayed)

## Customization

You can easily customize this game by:

- Changing the dice images in the `images` folder
- Modifying the styling in `styles.css`
- Adding more players by duplicating the dice divs and updating the JavaScript
